# canaiguess backend

canaiguess is a backend for an interactive game where players try to determine:  
**Was this image made by AI, or is it real?**

Players can try different game modes:
1. Single image: Guess if it‚Äôs real or AI
2. Pair: Which is AI? (one real, one fake)
3. Multiple images: Which ones are AI?

Leaderboards for signed-in users keep things competitive and fun!

## Dataset

We use public datasets to provide real and AI-generated images.

## **Potential Features**

- Registered users can upload their own images or try to ‚Äúfind an AI equivalent‚Äù of a real image (by matching labels or using a free AI generation API in the background)
- Users can challenge each other to solve their custom levels
- Real-time competitive games with friends
- Show how ‚Äúdifficult‚Äù an image is (‚Äúonly 9% of users guessed correctly!‚Äù). Tag images with difficulty level based on historical guess data.
- Let users see which images fooled them and others the most

---

## **‚ÄúCan you _really_ spot the difference between real and AI anymore?‚Äù**

Data from the game could be valuable for researchers working on human-AI perception, dataset labeling, or even training new AI-detection models.

## **Game Security**

- CAPTCHA test at the beginning for unauthorized users
