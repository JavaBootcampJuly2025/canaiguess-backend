# canaiguess backend

canaiguess is a backend for an interactive game where players try to determine:  
**Was this image made by AI, or is it real?**

Players can try different game modes:
1. Single image: Guess if it’s real or AI
2. Pair: Which is AI? (one real, one fake)
3. Multiple images: Which ones are AI?

Leaderboards for signed-in users keep things competitive and fun!

## Dataset

We use public datasets to provide real and AI-generated images.

## **Potential Features**

- Registered users can upload their own images or try to “find an AI equivalent” of a real image (by matching labels or using a free AI generation API in the background)
- Users can challenge each other to solve their custom levels
- Real-time competitive games with friends
- Show how “difficult” an image is (“only 9% of users guessed correctly!”). Tag images with difficulty level based on historical guess data.
- Let users see which images fooled them and others the most

## **“Can you _really_ spot the difference between real and AI anymore?”**

Data from the game could be valuable for researchers working on human-AI perception, dataset labeling, or even training new AI-detection models.

## **Game Security**
